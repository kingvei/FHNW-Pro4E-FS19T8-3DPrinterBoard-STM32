#### Abstract

> This report documents the development of a controller board and the adaptation of an open source Ô¨Årmware for a common hobbyist 3D printer. The innovative aspects of this hard- and software development are the usage of a 32-bit microcontroller as well as implementing a web interface for remote access. Part of the research included the incorporation of high-end stepper motor drivers, which detect a motor stall, thereby enabling a sensorless homing of the printer‚Äôs axes. A Creality Ender 3 Pro provided the mechanical elements of the printer hardware. The mainboard was built around an STM32F103 microcontroller with an ARM Cortex-M3 core.
TMC2660 drivers were used to drive the motors of the three axes (x, y, z) as well as the extruder. Furthermore, Wi-Fi compatibility was achieved by embedding an ESP32-WROOM-32 module on the mainboard. Every feature of the 3D printer, including the upload of G-code Ô¨Åles, can be controlled through the ESP3D Ô¨Årmware, which provides a web interface. Since the main processor uses a 32-bit architecture, the development branch of the Marlin Ô¨Årmware 2.0 was used. Additionally, the newly implemented over-the-air update feature can be used to conveniently upload the latest version of the Marlin Ô¨Årmware to the microcontroller. The use of the stall detection feature of the TMC2660 motor drivers proved to be feasible in order to omit mechanical limit switches on the x- and y-axis. On the z-axis, however, the stall detection feature showed to be too unreliable. Finally, the Marlin 2.0 Ô¨Årmware is in a working state
and the use of 32-bit microcontrollers is recommended for future developments of 3D printer hardware.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Hardware Issues

- wrong Footprint for NPN Transistors in ESP32 reset circuit

The SOT-23 footprint does not match the pinout of the transistor.

- Schematic Error on the LM2675M-x chips

The ON/!OFF pin (pin 5) on both DCDC converters must not be connected to 24V! The pin can only handle 6V. This pin can be left floating.

- The USB type-C receptable can only be soldered using a reflow oven
